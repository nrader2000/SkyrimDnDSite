                            <p> 
                                This is the amazing game of Skyrim focuesed into a tabletop style game! I continue to be in constant development of this game! 
                                I try to improve the gameplay with the new combat system that I mixed in from other DnD style tabletop games!
                                The combat in this game incorperates some of Skyrim's core mechanics, as well as some new stuff to make the game
                                feel more like a tabletop RPG. The game is in constant development and I'm always looking for ways to improve the game
                                so please contact me with any advise for what I could do to make this game better for everyone to enjoy!

                            <p> 
                                Hi i'm Nick Rader and this website for SkyrimDnD as well as the game itself was made by yours truly. I am 
                                currently a college student who goes to High Point University in North Carolina! I have learned so much from 
                                this great university and it has encouraged me to follow my passion of making content/games for the people of the world!
                                My first idea was this game itself! As a huge fan of Skyrim and DnD, I just had to make the two combine into a tabletop RPG.
                                If you want to contact me about this game or just chat, go to my <a href="Skyrim DnD Connect.html">Connect</a> page!
